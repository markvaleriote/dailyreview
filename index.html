           <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>My name is Mark Valeriote and I was

               February 10th 2000. My favorite things to 
               do are going to the lake, riding my bike,
               playing video games, hanging out with friends 
               and going to the gym. </p>
               <p>I have 1 sister named Brianna and she is 20 years old. 
               Some place I would like to visit someday is the 
               Bahamas because it would be fun to be able to 
               go scuba diving in clear water and it would also
               be very relaxing.</p>
